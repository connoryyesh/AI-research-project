/**
 * Survey Component
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * - This component serves as a placeholder for rendering survey questions built using the Survey Builder.
 * - In a full implementation, it would dynamically load and display those questions to the user (e.g., for preview or interaction).
 * 
 * When to extend this:
 * - If you want to render questions from the builder in real-time for previewing.
 * - If you want to test conditional logic or layout before deploying a full survey page.
